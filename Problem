# Stick-problem
 Scenario: You've got N sticks aligned parallel to each other. Each stick consist of two end points, top and bottom. Both end points are labelled with two numbers a[i] and b[i]. The number ranges from 1 to 9. you have to sum the numbers for each of the end point along all the stick. Problem: Lets call these sums s1 and s2. Now the goal is to have both these sums s1 and s2 to be an even number. Inorder to achieve that you can rotate any stick upside down, effectively swapping endpoints of any stick. Given the number of sticks and numbers labelled at each of its end point, find the minimum number of swaps required to achieve our goal. Input: First line is the number of sticks, followed by endpoints of each stick. Output: A single line containing number of minimum swaps required. If no swaps are required or possible, output -1.
